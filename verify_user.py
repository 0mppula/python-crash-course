# Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that
# the user has already entered their username or that the program is
# running for the first time. We should modify it in case the current
# user is not the person who last used the program.
# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user
# if this is the correct username. If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username()
# to get the correct username.
