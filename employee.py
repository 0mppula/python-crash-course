# Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should
# take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store
# each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that
# adds $5000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a
# different raise amount. Write a test case for Employee. Write two
# test methods, test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise().
# Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee
# instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both
# tests pass.
